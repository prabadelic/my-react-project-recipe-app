# Recipe CRUD App

This is a **React-based Recipe CRUD Application** built to manage and organize recipes. The app allows users to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** recipes using React's **useState()** for state management. The project interface is designed with a clean and intuitive layout, and data is displayed in a table for ease of access.
